**Aar-Act** (from CyberAar) is a volunteer-driven, open collaboration to gather and share **best practices** for securing Senegal's critical infrastructure against cyber threats.

Inspired by recent attacks (e.g., DAF breach in 2026), we unite Senegalese talents (home & diaspora) + global allies to build a living guide in French & English.

## Goal
Create a free, community-maintained resource (PDF/whitepaper eventually) with practical, context-adapted advice for sectors like:
- Energy & utilities
- Finance & banking
- Telecom & government systems
- Healthcare, transport, etc.

## How to Contribute (Super Easy!)
1. **Browse** existing sections or suggest new ones via Issues.
2. **Fork** this repo (or work in a branch).
3. **Add/Edit** Markdown files in `/practices/` folder (create if needed).
4. **Submit** a Pull Request (PR) — we'll review & merge quickly.
5. Get **credit** in the Contributors list & README!

No long commitments—add one tip when you have 10 minutes!

## Structure (Work in Progress)
- `/practices/` → Main content (one .md file per topic, e.g., `01-hardening-servers.md`)
- `/examples/` → Senegal-specific cases or templates
- `/translations/` → French versions

## First Steps
- Check Issues for open tasks.
- Comment here or on LinkedIn if you want to own a section!
